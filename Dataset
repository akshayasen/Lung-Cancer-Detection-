Contains lung images categorized into three classes:
lung_aca: Adenocarcinoma
lung_n: Normal tissue
lung_scc: Squamous cell carcinoma
Features high-resolution medical images suitable for deep learning.

Images are preprocessed through:
Resizing (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
Normalization for consistent pixel value ranges.
Augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling) to enhance model robustness.
